	---help---
        Many of the ST system-on-chip devices have multiple CPUs, where a
        master CPU running Linux has control over a number of slave CPUs,
        which are usually used to run dedicated algorithms.
        Enabling this option will add support to the Linux kernel to
        control these slave CPUs, reserve memory for them, and thus allow
        code to be downloaded onto them and executed.
        Adding in the command line the following string:
        coprocessor_mem=[offset]:size0[,size1][,size2]...
        where:
        offset defines where the co-processors region starts.
               It's an offset from ST40 RAM start.
        size{n} defines the region size for the n.th slave core (max 16M).

        Example: coprocessor_mem=32m:16m,16m

        Enable this option to print out information about the slave CPUs
        addresses and operations you are using for coprocessor.

config STM_RNG
       bool "STM Random Number Generator Support"
       default y
       ---help---
         This option adds support for the hardware Random Number Generator
         (RNG) present on different STMicroelectronics SoCs.  It allows the
         RNG to feed /dev/random with entropy thereby ensuring real
         random numbers from this device.

         Without this option, /dev/random has little entropy and is not
         useful.  In fact, it may block for a long time while waiting for
         entropy.

         This option should always be enabled for relevant SoCs.

         This option can be used in conjunction with the /dev/hw_random
         driver found in the char drivers menu.

	  This option enables the STMicroelectronics Power Management

	  This is a kernel framework based around power profiles (pms_state),
	  where the designer can specify devices power states and the
	  clock frequency rates.
	  Moving the system between pms_states the user application can
	  tune the power consumption according with what the system is doing.

config PMS_CHECK_GROUP

	depends on PMS
	default n
	help
	  Enable this option if the state group has to be controlled.
	  When a group of pms_states are enabled in the same time, this option
	  forces the PMS to check that there is no conflict inside the group
	  itself. In case of conflict the group is rejected.

config PMS_DEBUG

	  Enable this option to print out information about the PMS
